.. rubric:: Connecting Emulator
   :name: connecting-emulator

**Note: This EVM setup is only required for developers who need to
connect to cores using Code Composer studio to load application.**

The JTAG emulation pins for the EVM are on the back of the processor
module. User need to carefully unmount the processor module from the LCD
panel in order to get access to the JTAG pins.

Refer to the image below for how to safely separate the processor module
from the LCD panel.

.. Image:: /images/CUI_Isolated_Power_Supply.png

Please note that a power supply is NOT included with the AM572x
Evaluation Module and needs to be purchased separately. A power supply
with the following specs is needed:

-  12V DC output
-  5A output
-  Positive inner and negative outer terminals
-  Female barrel with 2.5mm inner diameter and 5.5mm outer diameter
-  Isolated power supply

.. rubric:: PMIC auto-off after seven seconds
   :name: pmic-auto-off-after-seven-seconds

The Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) on the TMDSEVM572X turns
off the board in seven seconds after power on to work around a hardware
errata. After seven seconds, the PMIC powers off unless software writes
to a PMIC register to keep it on.

In emulation setup, the GEL file will keep the PMIC on after you connect
to the A15 core on the SoC. While booting from ROM bootloader user
application software, would need to keep the PMIC ON while initializing
the board.

In Linux boot, the uboot code keeps the PMIC On and in the TI RTOS boot
scenario, the SBL component provides the same functionality

**NOTE**

-  To allow quicker execution of the GEL before the PMIC shuts off, you
   can increase the JTAG TCLK Frequency in Advance settings of your
   target configuration to 15Mhz or to the maximum (20Mhz).
-  If the above CCS connect sequence does not work in the first attempt,
   it means that the PMIC switched off before the GEL could initialize
   I2C and modify the PMIC settings. In that case, the connection has
   failed, hit connect in CCS debug view without removing the power
   cable and then immediately hit the power switch besides the power
   plug.

There are two scenarios while connecting to the EVM :

-  **Connect to EVM without a SD card boot image to boot the EVM**
-  **Connect to EVM after booting an image from the SD card**.

.. rubric:: Connect without a SD card boot image
   :name: connect-without-a-sd-card-boot-image

.. rubric:: Configuring target configuration files
   :name: configuring-target-configuration-files

Launch CCS and create new target configuration(File->New->Target
Configuration file) as shown in the images below and provide appropriate
name to the configuration. Select Spectrum digital XDS200 emulator and
target as GPEVM\_AM572x\_SiRevA.

**Note:** For older revisions of CCSv6, If you don\`t find the
GPEVM\_AM572x\_SiRevA target make sure you have installed the CCSv6
package with support for Sitara Processors and done the software update
correctly from the Help Menu to get the latest Sitara CSP package.

.. rubric:: Connecting to target
   :name: connecting-to-target

**Step1 :** Download Code composer Studio and AM572x Sitara CSP package
as described in the wiki article mentioned below:

`Install Code composer Studio v6 for
AM572x <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Processor_SDK_RTOS_Getting_Started_Guide#Code_Composer_Studio>`__

**Step2:** AM572x EVM doesn\`t have any boot switches to configure for
emulation mode. so configure the boot switches to SD Boot Mode. Dont
Populate the uSD card when the intent is to connect and load code over
emulator and not to boot the device using uSD card.

**Step3:** Connect an XDS200 Emulator to emulation pins at the back of
the GP EVM as shown in
section.\ `Connecting\_Emulator <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/AM572x_GP_EVM_Hardware_Setup#Connecting_Emulator>`__

**Step4:** Launch CCS and create new target configuration as discussed
in the previous section.

|
| **Step5**: Launch Target configuration you just created. AM572x is an
  ARM master boot device so connect to the A15\_0 first. It is also
  recommended that you do a CPU reset from (Run->Reset->CPU Reset) Menu
  on the A15 to put it in a clean state as the EVM is designed to come
  up in SD boot mode.

|
| **Note: Keep in mind the PMIC shutdown issue discussed in previous
  section while connecting to the target cores. Due to the PMIC shutdown
  issue, users need to connect to A15\_0 as soon as you push the power
  button to enable power to the SoC.**

.. rubric:: Multi-core Initialization
   :name: multi-core-initialization

After connecting to the boot master core -- typically the ARM core --
you may need to connect to a slave core in order to run code. Depending
on your SOC, the slave core can be

-  DSP C66x
-  ARM M4
-  PRUSS
-  IVAHD

Typically the slave cores will wait in reset state until the master core
wakes up the slave core to run code. To connect to the slave core on
AM57x, go to **Scripts** menu in CCS Debug View and under **AM572x
MULTICORE Initialization** enable the corresponding sub system clock.
For example, enable ``DSP11SSClkEnable_API`` for the first DSP core.
After running the clock enable option, you can connect to the core.

.. Image:: /images/Multicore-Enable.jpg

If you wish to run TI RTOS code on DSP, please also run the `Timer
Suspend Control
Options <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/AM572x_GP_EVM_Hardware_Setup#Timer_Suspend_Control_Options_for_DSP>`__.

|

.. rubric:: Connect after booting from SD card
   :name: connect-after-booting-from-sd-card

When you boot an image from the SD card, the secondary boot loader will
configure the device clocks, DDR and wake up the slave cores on the
AM572x processor on GP EVM hence you don\`t need the GEL initialization
scripts to redo the clock and DDR settings.

**Note:** If you are running the Image processing demo or have created
an SD card with the SBL (mlo) for booting the board then please follow
the following procedure

.. rubric:: Configuring target configuration files
   :name: configuring-target-configuration-files-1

Launch CCS and create new target configuration(File->New->Target
Configuration file) as shown in the images below and provide appropriate
name to the configuration. Select Spectrum digital XDS200 emulator and
target as AM5728\_RevA. This target setting will not populate the GEL
files when you connect to the target

**Note:** If you don\`t find the AM572x\_RevA target make sure you have
installed the CCSv6.1.1 package and done the software update correctly.

.. rubric:: GEL file options
   :name: gel-file-options

.. rubric:: Changing SoC Operating point
   :name: changing-soc-operating-point

The GEL file for setting the clocks on the SoC provides 3 Operating
points OPP\_NOM, OPP\_OD and OPP\_HIGH.

**OPP\_NOM PLL Settings:**

-  ARM = 1000 MHz
-  DSP = 600 Mhz
-  IVA = 532 Mhz

**OPP\_OD PLL Settings:**

-  ARM = 1176 MHz
-  DSP = 600 Mhz
-  IVA = 430 Mhz
-  GPU =500 Mhz

**OPP\_HIGH PLL Settings:**

-  ARM = 1500 MHz
-  DSP = 700 Mhz
-  GPU = 425 Mhz
-  IVA = 388.3 Mhz

.. rubric:: Timer Suspend Control Options for DSP
   :name: timer-suspend-control-options-for-dsp

On AM57xx devices, all the timers on the chip have their suspend control
signal routed to the A15 core. Which means that if any of the slave
cores are using these timers, the timers will continue to run even when
the slave core has been paused. The timer will only pause when the A15
core is halted.

This is confusing while debugging code on slave cores if you are relying
on timer for logging, inserting delays or if the timer keeps firing
interrupts even when the core is halted. One such scenario occurs with
*GPtimer5* when DSP developers are using SYS/BIOS. The OS uses
*GPtimer5* on the DSP and forces a frequency check to confirm the timer
configuration, however the OS can't gain access to the timer due to the
hook up of the suspend control signals.

Due to this issue the SYS/BIOS developers will need to configure an
additional CCS configuration check to connect the GPTimer suspend
control signal to the DSP as shown in the image below:
