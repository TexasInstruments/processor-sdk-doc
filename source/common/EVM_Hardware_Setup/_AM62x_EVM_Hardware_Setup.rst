AM62x SK EVM Hardware Setup
===========================

.. rubric:: Description

The AM62x starter kit (SK) evaluation module (EVM) is a stand-alone test and development platform
built around the AM62x system-on-a-chip (SoC). AM62x processors are comprised of a quad-core 64-bit
Arm®-Cortex®-A53 microprocessor, single-core Arm Cortex-R5F microcontroller (MCU) and an Arm
Cortex-M4F MCU.
