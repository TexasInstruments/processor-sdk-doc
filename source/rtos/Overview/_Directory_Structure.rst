Overview
===========
The Processor SDK for RTOS contain a number of software components,
including a top-level RTOS SDK directory. These components are all
installed in one common install path specified when running the
installer.

.. note::
   Not all components are applicable on all platforms.

Software Component Directories
================================
Here is a sample directory layout for the AM57x RTOS SDK:

Processor-SDK Directory
========================
The Processor SDK for RTOS contains a top-level RTOS SDK directory:

::

     [SDK Install Path]/processor_sdk_rtos_<platform>_<version>/

The default SDK Install Path is ``C:\TI`` for Windows and
``/home/[user]/ti`` for Linux.

This directory contains the following top-level directories and files;
here is an example for AM57x:

.. Image:: /images/Processor-SDK-RTOS-directory-top.png

These directories contain the collateral and tools applicable for RTOS:

-  **bin** - Contains the helper scripts for configuring the host system
   and target device. Based on EVM capability, examples include scripts
   to create an SD card with an RTOS application, script to flash EVM
   with bootable application

-  **demos** - Contains demonstrations that implements interesting
   features. Additionally, these demonstrations serve as a template to
   start writing an application

-  **docs** - Contains various documentation such as the software
   manifest and release notes

-  **prebuilt-sdcards** - Contains prebuilt SD card images that can be
   copied to an SD card and used to load the EVM (AM3, AM4, AM5 only)

-  **prebuilt-images** - Contains prebuilt images to flash images to
   write to EVM flash (K2x only)

-  **makefile** - Provides build targets for SDK components from the
   top-level of the SDK

-  **setupenv.bat** - Configures the user Windows host system to prepare
   to invoke the makefile

-  **setupenv.sh** - Configures the user Linux host system to prepare to
   invoke the makefile
