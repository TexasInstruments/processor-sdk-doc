RPMsg Quick Start Guide
-----------------------

.. contents:: :local:

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

RPMsg is a method of passing messages and data between the PRU cores and
the ARM core running Linux. RPMsg is
enabled by a combination of remoteproc and the virtio framework. For
more information about remoteproc, reference
:ref:`pru_remoteproc`. For more information abour RPMsg, reference
:ref:`pru_rpmsg`.

This Quick Start Guide will walk you through every step necessary to run
your first RPMsg example, from downloading the Linux Processor SDK, all
the way up to communicating with the PRUs from user space.

If you are familiar with the Linux Processor SDK from Texas Instruments
then portions of this guide will seem elementary or possibly redundant.
If this is the case, feel free to skip over the early sections and get
directly to the RPMsg parts. The intent of this guide is to provide a
single straight through process to run an RPMsg example and then show
where to modify and rebuild code in order to start PRU/RPMsg
development.

If you have any questions or corrections while going through this guide
please post them on the E2E Forum `here <https://e2e.ti.com>`__.

Supported Devices

Hardware Assumptions
""""""""""""""""""""

The below hardware assumptions have been made while writing this guide:

#. The reader has a host computer running Ubuntu Linux (Ubuntu version 14.04 was
   used while writing this document)

#. The reader has a TI EVM with with a micro SD card and the cables necessary
   for Linux console output

|

Getting the Linux Processor SDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is to download and install the Linux Processor SDK onto
your host computer that is running Ubuntu Linux.

#. Download the SDK that corresponds to the evaluation board that you
   have

   -  `Linux Processor SDK for
      AM335x <https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-AM335X>`__
   -  `Linux Processor SDK for
      AM437x <https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-AM437X>`__
   -  `Linux Processor SDK for
      AM572x <https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-AM57X>`__
   -  `Linux Processor SDK for
      AM65x <https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-AM65X>`__
   -  `Linux Processor SDK for
      K2G <https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-K2G>`__

   **You only need to download the
   ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>-Linux-x86-Install.bin file
   from this page**

#. Navigate to the newly downloaded bin file and make it executable

   -   cd path/to/downloaded/SDK/bin/file/

   -   chmod +x ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>-Linux-x86-Install.bin

#. Launch the installer

   -   ./ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>-Linux-x86-Install.bin

#. Follow the steps in the installer to complete the installation

   -  The remainder of this guide assumes that the default installation
      directory was selected -
      /home/user/ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>/

You now have the Linux Processor SDK installed on your Linux host
computer. This version of the SDK includes the `PRU Software Support
Package <https://git.ti.com/pru-software-support-package/pru-software-support-package/trees/master>`__
in the 'example-applications/pru-icss-x.y.z' folder. This software
support package includes examples, libraries, and :ref:`pru_hands_on_labs`
to help you get started
with your PRU development process. This guide will use one of the PRU
RPMsg examples included in that software support package.

Configuring and Building the Linux Kernel with RPMsg Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Linux kernel config that ships with this version of the Linux
Processor SDK already has RPMsg module support enabled. The rest of
this section is to show how/where to enable/disable the modules using
menuconfig and how to rebuild the modules and kernel if you would like
to make any changes to the modules, kernel, or device tree.

In the interest of simplicity, this guide will follow the full
procedure found in the Linux SDK Kernel :ref:`linux_kernel_users_guide` even
though some of
these steps may not be absolutely necessary for our purposes.

#. Navigate to the Linux kernel source directory in the Linux Processor
   SDK that we previously installed (this guide assumes the default
   installation directory was chosen)

   -   cd /home/user/ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>/board-support/linux-x.x.x+gitAUTOINC+YYY-ZZZ/

#. Place the cross-compiler toolchain in your PATH environment variable

   ::

       export PATH=/home/user/ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin:$PATH

#. Clean the kernel sources

   -   make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- distclean

#. Set the kernel configuration to the default configuration included in
   the Processor SDK for the device you are using

   -   make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- tisdk_<DEV>-evm_defconfig

#. Enable RPMsg support using menuconfig

   #.  make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig

   #. Type 'm' next to the following two configurations to build them as
      kernel modules (beginning with Linux Processor SDK v02.00.02.11
      these modules will be enabled by default)

      -   Device Drivers > Remoteproc Drivers > TI PRUSS remoteproc support
      -   Device Drivers > Rpmsg drivers > PRU RPMsg Communication driver

      **If you type 'y' instead of 'm' next to these modules then your
      board will pause for a long time during the boot procedure and the
      PRU loading process will fail**

   #. Save the configuration and exit menuconfig

#. Build the Linux kernel

   -   make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage

#. Build the device tree binary file

   -   make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- am335x-boneblack.dtb

   **Example .dtb name given above is for the BeagleBone Black. To find
   the .dtb name for a different board use the list found at
   :ref:`kernel_users_guide_compiling_the_device_tree_binaries`.**

#. Build the modules

   -   make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- modules

Creating a Bootable SD Card with RPMsg Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section of the guide will walk you through using a script that is
included in the Linux Processor SDK. This script will format your micro
SD card and load the default images for the Linux kernel, device tree,
and filesystem. Once we've created the default SD card we will overwrite
the kernel, device tree, and modules with the newly built versions from
the previous section of this guide. At the end of this section we will
have a bootable SD card (that includes RPMsg support) that we can plug
into a board, turn on power, and get to a Linux login prompt.

#. Plug your micro SD card into your Ubuntu host computer

   -  If your computer doesn't have an SD card reader you will need a
      USB card reader

#. Change to the 'bin' directory in the Processor SDK

   -   cd /home/user/ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>/bin/

#. Run the SD card creation script with sudo rights and enter your
   password when prompted

   -   sudo ./create-sdcard.sh

#. Select the SD card from the list the script provides

   .. image:: /images/Rpmsg_Sdcard_create_device.PNG

#. Select that you would like to partition the drive with 2 partitions

#. Once partitioning is completed select 'y' and continue with
   installing the filesystem

#. Now choose '1' to install the pre-built images from the SDK

At this point, we've used the SD card creation script to make a bootable
SD card with the default, out-of-box, Linux kernel and filesystem as it
ships in the Processor SDK. Now we just need to replace the kernel,
device tree, and modules on the SD card with the ones that we rebuilt in
the previous section. Let's do that now.

#. The SD card creation script unmounts the SD card when it finishes.
   Unplug the SD card and then plug it back into your computer to
   re-mount it. In Ubuntu 14.04 the card auto-mounts the two partitions
   to the **/media/user/boot/** and **/media/user/rootfs/** directories.

#. The kernel and device tree file that the board will use to boot is
   located in the **/media/user/rootfs/boot/** directory. If you check
   that directory now you will see that it is filled with default
   kernels, default device trees, and symbolic links. To make this guide
   simple and to also show that we are in fact booting our newly built
   kernel and device tree, let's delete everything in this boot
   directory

   -   sudo rm /media/user/rootfs/boot/*

#. Navigate to the Linux kernel source directory

   -   cd /home/user/ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>/board-support/linux-x.y.z+gitAUTOINC+YYY-ZZZ/

#. Copy the new kernel to the SD card

   -   sudo cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /media/user/rootfs/boot/

#. Copy the new device tree binary to the SD card

   -   sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-boneblack.dtb /media/user/rootfs/boot/

   **Once again the example .dtb given above is for the BeagleBone
   Black. Check
   :ref:`kernel_users_guide_compiling_the_device_tree_binaries`
   and use the corresponding name if you are using a different board.**

#. Install the newly built modules onto the SD card filesystem

   -   sudo make ARCH=arm INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/user/rootfs/ modules_install

#. Synchronize the data on the disk with the memory to make sure all of
   the files have completed copying over to the SD card

   -   sync

#. Unmount the two SD card partitions from your Ubuntu host computer

   -   sudo umount -f /media/user/rootfs

   -   sudo umount -f /media/user/boot

Booting the Board and Testing RPMsg
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /images/RPMsg_OOB_terminal.png


#. Make sure your board is set up to boot from the SD card

   **If your board is not set up to boot from the SD card, follow the
   instructions on the bottom of this page**
   :ref:`rpmsg_board_is_not_set_up_for_sd_card_boot`

#. Plug the SD card from the previous step into your evaluation board

#. Plug the serial cable from your evaluation board into your Ubuntu
   host computer

   -  Reference your evaluation board getting started guide to determine
      which cable you will need and where you will need to plug it into
      the evaluation board

   -  In the case of the BeagleBone Black you will need an FTDI to TTL
      cable like the one found
      `here <https://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Black_Accessories#Serial_Debug_Cables>`__

#. Find out which tty device on your Ubuntu host computer corresponds to
   your evaluation board

   -   ls /dev/ | grep ttyUSB*

   **Depending on the evaluation board you may need to power the board
   up before the ttyUSBn device shows up on your Ubuntu computer**

#. Use your favorite terminal emulator to connect to your evaluation
   board (in the example given below I use picocom and my device is on
   /dev/ttyUSB0)

   -   sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0

#. Power up your evaluation board

   -  Power up method (button press, power source, etc.) will also vary
      based on which board you are using

#. Wait for the board to complete booting and arrive at the '<DEV>-evm
   login:' prompt and type 'root' to login as root

   -   <DEV>-evm login: root

#. Use the remoteproc sysfs interface to specify the firmware name to
   boot and to start the PRU cores

   -  echo 'am335x-pru0-fw' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc1/firmware

   -  echo 'am335x-pru1-fw' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc2/firmware

   -  echo 'start' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc1/state

   -  echo 'start' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc2/state

#. List all of the devices under /dev/ and look for the two rpmsg_pru
   character devices

   -   ls /dev/

   or

   -   ls /dev/ | grep pru

#. Write to each of the character devices to test them out

   -   echo "test30" > /dev/rpmsg_pru30

   -   echo "test31" > /dev/rpmsg_pru31

#. Now read from each of the character devices to make sure that the
   PRUs echoed the test strings back

   -   cat /dev/rpmsg_pru30

   **You will need to press 'Ctrl + c' to stop reading and close the
   character device**

   -   cat /dev/rpmsg_pru31

   **You will need to press 'Ctrl + c' to stop reading and close the
   character device**

Out of Box Demo Explanation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Linux Processor SDK comes with demo PRU firmwares loaded in the
filesystem. These PRU firmwares echo all received RPMsgs directly back
to the sender. That's why when we write to the rpmsg_pru character
device in the section above, we can then read the exact same message
back from the same rpmsg_pru character device. The written message was
actually delivered to the PRU as an RPMsg and then a second RPMsg was
generated by the PRU (with the same payload) and sent back to the ARM on
the same RPMsg channel/character device that sent the original message.
The source code for these demo PRU projects can be found in the SDK's
example-applications/pru-icss-x.y.z/examples/<DEV>/ folder under
PRU_RPMsg_Echo_Interruptn. The next section will teach you how to
rebuild those demo firmwares from source, place the generated binary in
the embedded file system, and then reload and re-run the PRUs with the
newly built firmware.

Getting Started with RPMsg Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rebuilding the PRU Firmwares from Source
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The source code for the PRU firmwares that are used in this out-of-box
demo can be found in the Linux Processor SDK in the
'example-applications/pru-icss-x.y.z/examples/' folder:

-  Examples Used

   -  /home/user/ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>/example-applications/pru-icss-x.y.z/examples/<DEV>/PRU_RPMsg_Echo_InterruptN
      (or PRU_RPMsg_Echo_InterruptM_N if there are 4 PRUs in the
      device)

To rebuild the firmwares from source code use the Makefile provided in
each folder:

#. Navigate to the directory of the example that you want to rebuild

   -   cd /home/user/ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>/example-applications/pru-icss-x.y.z/examples/<DEV>/PRU_RPMsg_Echo_InterruptN

#. Export the location of the PRU Code Generation Tools that are
   provided in the Linux Processor SDK

   -   export PRU_CGT=/home/user/ti-processor-sdk-linux-<DEV>-evm-<VERSION>/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/share/ti/cgt-pru

#. Clean the directory

   -   make clean

#. Rebuild the project and generate the .out file in the 'gen' directory

   -   make

#. Move to the 'gen' directory in the project folder to see the
   generated .out file

   -   cd gen/

   -   ls

Placing the Rebuilt Firmware into the Embedded Linux File System
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The pruss_remoteproc module is responsible for loading the PRU
firmwares and resetting the PRUs. This module expects to find the PRU
firmwares in the device file system at the following locations. The name
of the firmware to be loaded is specified using the sysfs interace
mentioned earlier.

Out of the box, the file system provided in the Linux Processor SDK has
symbolic links in the **/lib/firmware** directory that point to the
RPMsg examples in the **/lib/firmware/pru** directory. In order to get
the PRUs to use your newly built firmware you will need to take the .out
file from the 'gen/' directory and:

-  rename it to be one of the firmware names above and place it in the
   /lib/firmware/ directory

   -  E.g. rename PRU_RPMsg_Echo_Interrupt0.out to am335x-pru0-fw and
      place it in the /lib/firmware/ directory

   or
-  place the .out file anywhere in the embedded Linux filesystem and
   then create a symbolic link matching the firmware name above that
   points to the .out file

   -  E.g. place PRU_RPMsg_Echo_Interrupt0.out in the
      /lib/firmware/pru/ directory and then make sure the
      /lib/firmware/am335x-pru0-fw symbolic link points to that file


.. note::

    In the latest version of the Linux Processor SDK it is
    possible to use the remoteproc sysfs interface to specify the name of
    the firmware you would like to load from the **/lib/firmware/**
    directory. Please see see :ref:`pru_hands_on_labs_lab_5`
    in the :ref:`pru_hands_on_labs` for an
    example of this method. So, the **am335x-pru0-fw** name being used on
    this page isn't absolutely necessary, but for legacy reasons is being
    shown here.


Loading the New Code into the PRUs and Running
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The PRUs must be stopped before loading new firmware code into them. In
order to stop the PRUs, either reset your board, or use the below code
to stop the PRUs through the sysfs interface.

::

   echo 'stop' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc1/state
   echo 'stop' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc2/state

Use the remoteproc sysfs interface to point the remoteproc driver to the
newly built firmwares for each PRU.

::

   echo 'am335x-pru0-fw' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc1/firmware
   echo 'am335x-pru1-fw' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc2/firmware

Finally, use the remoteproc sysfs to load and the run the PRU cores.

::

   echo 'start' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc1/state
   echo 'start' > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc2/state

For a more detailed explanation on the internals of the PRU firmwares
being used as well as how to start making modifications for your
specific use case, please see :ref:`pru_hands_on_labs_lab_5`
and :ref:`pru_hands_on_labs_lab_6`
in the :ref:`pru_hands_on_labs`

Common Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _rpmsg_board_is_not_set_up_for_sd_card_boot:

Board is Not Set Up for SD Card Boot
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This guide shows the SD card boot method where the evaluation device
expects to find the kernel (zImage), device tree binary (.dtb file), and
file system all on the SD card. If that is not the case on your
evaluation board, this section will walk you through the U-Boot changes
necessary to make your board use SD card boot.

#. Open a serial port connection to your device from your Ubuntu host
   computer

   -   sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0

#. Power up your evaluation board and press Enter when prompted to 'Hit
   any key to stop autoboot: 1'. This will stop the boot process at the
   U-Boot prompt

   .. image:: /images/Rpmsg_U-boot_prompt.PNG

#. Reset the U-Boot environment variables to the default settings

   -   env default -f -a

#. Save the default settings

   -   saveenv

#. Set the ip_method to none

   -   setenv ip_method none

#. Set the name of the bootfile to zImage

   -   setenv bootfile zImage

#. Set the getuenv environment variable

   -   setenv getuenv 'if mmc rescan; then if run loadbootenv; then run importbootenv; fi; fi;'

#. Set the boot command

   -   setenv bootcmd 'mmc rescan; run findfdt; run getuenv; run loadimage; run loadfdt; run mmcargs; bootz ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}'

#. Save the new environment variables

   -   saveenv

#. Use the new environment variables to boot from the SD card

   -   boot
