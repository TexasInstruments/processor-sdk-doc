Introduction
============

TI SOCs like AM335x, AM437x, AM57xx and AM65xx are enabled with 3D cores,
capable of accelerating 3D operations with dedicated hardware. The
dedicated hardware is based on SGX series of devices from Imagination
Technologies. The graphics cores only accelerate graphics operations,
and do not perform video decode operations. For video acceleration,
refer to respective Technical Reference Manuals for the SOCs.

Below table lists the various TI families supported by this SDK, and the
SGX core information

The SGX cores in AM family support OpenGL\ |reg| ES 1.1 and OpenGL\ |reg| ES
2.0 APIs.

These devices do not utilize static memory carveouts. The only reservations
made in device tree are for control registers. Memory is instead dynamically
allocated at runtime depending on the task and will scale accordingly.
Buffers are allocated from CMA and other runtime memory allocations are made
from standard pages. See the kernel module memory management subsystem for
more information.

Software Architecture
=====================

The picture below shows the software architecture of Graphics in
|__SDK_FULL_NAME__|.

   Graphics Software Stack

Please see the :doc:`Build_Guide` for more information about integration of this
software stack into other ecosystems.

Graphics Demos
==============

Along with the graphics driver and userspace libraries, the SDK also includes
example applications. Some of the demos are based on the IMG
Native_SDK examples.

The following demos are available to run under the Wayland windowing system.

.. code-block:: console

   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/Wayland/OpenGLESDeferredShading
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/Wayland/OpenGLESGaussianBlur
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/Wayland/OpenGLESImageBasedLighting
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/Wayland/OpenGLESIntroducingPVRCamera
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/Wayland/OpenGLESIntroducingPVRUtils
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/Wayland/OpenGLESIntroducingUIRenderer
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/Wayland/OpenGLESNavigation2D
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/Wayland/OpenGLESNavigation3D
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/Wayland/OpenGLESParticleSystem

Running demos in Null Window system mode
----------------------------------------

The graphics demos can also be run in null-window system mode outside of Wayland
windowing system as full screen applications. In order to do so, exit Weston by
pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace from the keyboard which connects to the EVM. Then,
if the LCD screen stays in "Please wait...", press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to go to the
command line on LCD console. After that, the command line can be used from
serial console, SSH console, or LCD console.

Please make sure the board is connected to at least one display before
running these demos.

.. code-block:: console

   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2Coverflow
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2ChameleonMan
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2ExampleUI
   # /usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2Navigation

After you see the output on the display interface, hit *q* to terminate
the application.

Some of the demos under null windowing system require the user to pass in
the drm connector id. For information on how to get connector id please
refer to the :doc:`../Common/Display` section.
