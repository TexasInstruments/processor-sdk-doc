Vulkan
######

The Vulkan\ |reg| libraries are packaged with the |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| and can be
used by graphics stacks such as Qt and GTK. The drivers run on an ARM core and
programs the firmware running inside a GPU core with rendering commands
submitted by the user applications.

Vulkan\ |reg| is a relatively new API that focuses on increased verbosity and
control over the device as opposed to OpenGL\ |reg| ES, which was initially
intended to abstract common processing functions for developers. As a result, it
can be written by hand but it is usually advised to use an existing abstraction
framework, such as the previously mentioned GTK or Qt widget based framework.
