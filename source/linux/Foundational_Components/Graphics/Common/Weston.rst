Weston
######

The supported Wayland/Weston version brings in the multiple display support in
extended desktop mode and the ability to drag-and-drop windows from one display
to the other.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62PX', 'J722S')

   The |__PART_FAMILY_NAME__| group of devices actually utilizes two separate
   DSS modules enumerated under two different :file:`/dev/dri/card*` devices.

   Weston versions newer than ``11.0.91`` can specify additional card devices
   via the ``--additional-devices`` command line parameter.

   To launch Weston using both card0 and card1, you can use the following
   command:

   .. code-block:: console

      # weston --drm-device=card0 --additional-devices=card1

   You may also modify the weston service to have systemd do this automatically
   on launch by using ``systemctl edit weston`` and inserting the following:

   .. code-block:: ini

      [Serivce]
      ExecStart=/usr/bin/weston --modules=systemd-notify.so --drm-device=card0 --additional-devices=card1

   Please note, however, that Weston cannot use by-path identifiers and
   consistent naming of DRI devices is not the default behavior.

****************************
Starting Weston with Systemd
****************************

Starting with Weston 10, the preferred way to start Weston is with the
``weston`` user using the systemd service. If you need to interact with this
instance using any other user then make sure that user is in the ``wayland`` or
``root`` group and direct them to interact with that instance using the global
socket at ``/run/wayland-0``.

This global socket is special in that it will automatically launch Weston when
a GUI application attempts to connect to it. A profile script in
``/etc/profile.d`` will automatically set the ``WAYLAND_DISPLAY`` environment
variable if the user has sufficient permission to interact with the socket.

To start the systemd service manually, do the following:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl start weston

To inspect the systemd service and socket status, do the following:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl status weston.service weston.socket


************************
Starting Weston Manually
************************

To launch Weston manually, do the following:

On the target console:

.. code-block:: console

   # unset WAYLAND_DISPLAY

On the default display:

.. code-block:: console

   # weston --display=<default connector-id>

On the secondary display:

.. code-block:: console

   # weston --display=<secondary connector-id>

On all connected displays (LCD and HDMI):

.. code-block:: console

   # weston

By default, the screensaver timeout is configured to 300 seconds. The user can
change the screensaver timeout using a command line option:

.. code-block:: text

   --idle-time=<number of seconds>

For example, to set timeout of 10 minutes and Weston configured to
display on all connectors, use the below command:

.. code-block:: console

   # weston --idle-time=600

To disable the screen timeout and to configure Weston to display on all
connectors, use the below command:

.. code-block:: console

   # weston --idle-time=0

If you face any issues with the above procedure, please refer to `the upstream
weston documentation`_ for troubleshooting tips.

.. _the upstream weston documentation:
   https://wayland.pages.freedesktop.org/weston/toc/running-weston.html

The filesystem comes with a preconfigured :file:`weston.ini` file which will
be located at :file:`/etc/xdg/weston/weston.ini`

.. _stopping-weston:

***************
Stopping Weston
***************

Terminate all Weston clients before exiting Weston. If you have invoked
Weston from the serial console, exit Weston by pressing Ctrl-C.

If Weston was started automatically by the init system then it can be stopped
with:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl stop weston

It is also possible to invoke Weston from the native console, exit
Weston by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace.

**********************
Running Weston clients
**********************

Weston client examples can run from the command line on a serial port
console or an SSH console. After launching Weston, the user should be
able to use the keyboard and the mouse for various controls.

.. code-block:: console

   # /usr/bin/weston-flower
   # /usr/bin/weston-clickdot
   # /usr/bin/weston-cliptest
   # /usr/bin/weston-dnd
   # /usr/bin/weston-editor
   # /usr/bin/weston-eventdemo
   # /usr/bin/weston-image /usr/share/weston/terminal.png
   # /usr/bin/weston-resizor
   # /usr/bin/weston-simple-egl
   # /usr/bin/weston-simple-shm
   # /usr/bin/weston-simple-touch
   # /usr/bin/weston-smoke
   # /usr/bin/weston-info
   # /usr/bin/weston-terminal

************************************
Running multimedia with Wayland sink
************************************

The GStreamer video sink for Wayland is the waylandsink. To use this
video-sink for video playback:

.. code-block:: console

   # gst-launch-1.0 playbin uri=file://<path-to-file-name> video-sink=waylandsink

***********************
Using IVI shell feature
***********************

The SDK also has support for configuring Weston ivi-shell. The default shell
that is configured in the SDK is the desktop-shell.

To change the shell to ivi-shell, the user will have to add the following lines
into the :file:`/etc/xdg/weston/weston.ini`.

To switch back to the desktop-shell can be done by commenting these lines in the
:file:`/etc/xdg/weston/weston.ini` (comments begin with a '#' at the start of
line).

.. code-block:: ini

   [core]
   shell=ivi-shell.so

After the above configuration is completed, we can restart Weston by
running the following command

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl restart weston

.. note::

   When Weston starts with ivi-shell, the default background is black, this is
   different from the desktop-shell that brings up a window with background.

With ivi-shell configured for Weston, Wayland client applications use
ivi-application protocol to be managed by a central HMI window management.

Applications must support the ``ivi_application`` Wayland protocol to be managed by
the HMI central controller with an unique numeric ID.
