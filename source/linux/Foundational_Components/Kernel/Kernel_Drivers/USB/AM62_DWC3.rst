Introduction
************

The USB subsystem has a USB2.0 Dual-Role-Device (DRD) controller,
with on-chip  HS/FS/LS (USB2.0) PHY.

.. note::
    LowSpeed (LS) is only supported in host mode.


TI SoC Integration
******************

The USB subsystem is integrated in TI |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| devices.

Starter Kit (SK)
****************

The two instances of USB controller present in AM62 SoC are brought on the Starter Kit(SK)
board. The zeroth instance is brought out with a Type C port(labelled as J13) through a
TPS65987D USB Type-C PD controller. The role detection is done by the PD controller
and updates are sent to the USB driver using the Role switch framework. The first
instance is brought out with a Type A port(labelled as J7).


.. rubric:: **Driver Configuration**
   :name: driver-configuration-dwc3

The default kernel configuration enables support for USB\_DWC3
and USB\_DWC3\_AM62 (the wrapper driver).

The selection of DWC3 driver can be modified as follows: start Linux
Kernel Configuration tool.

::

    $ make menuconfig  ARCH=arm64

-  Select Device Drivers from the main menu.
