PRUSS
---------------------------------

.. rubric:: **Introduction**
   :name: introduction-linux-pruss-ethernet-ug

All the Industrial Development Kit (IDK) boards can support 2 Ethernet
ports per PRUSS (Programmable Real-time Unit Subsystem). Although it is
meant to support real-time Industrial Ethernet protocols this wiki page
will only describe how to get standard Ethernet working using the
Kernel's PRU Ethernet driver.

Below figure shows the PRU Ethernet Driver architecture.

.. rubric:: **Overview**
   :name: overview-kernel-core-pruss

Each PRUSS instance contains 2 PRU cores and 2 Ethernet PHY interfaces.
This means that each PRU core can fully own one Ethernet port allowing
us to create a dual Ethernet solution. The firmware running on each PRU
implements the Ethernet MAC application. It uses the System OCMC RAM to
exchange network packets between firmware and PRU Ethernet kernel
driver.

Before the PRU Ethernet kernel driver can start transferring packets,
the following things have to be done:

-  Initialize the PRU cores and load the correct formware. This is taken
   care by the Remoteproc core via the PRU Remoteproc driver
   (pru\_rproc.c).
-  Initialize the PRUSS Interrupt Controller (INTC) and configure the
   interrupt mapping as per firmware requirement. This is done by the
   PRUSS INTC driver (pruss\_intc.c).
-  Initialize the Ethernet PHYs over the MDIO interface. This is done by
   the PHY MDIO driver (davinci\_mdio.c).

Once all initialization is done the PRU Ethernet driver (prueth.c) takes
over and interfaces with the firmware using PRUSS internal RAM (DRAM &
SRAM) and the System OCMC RAM. It also interfaces to the Linux
Networking stack to provide the standard networking interface to user
space.

.. rubric:: **Board specific Setup Details**
   :name: board-specific-setup-details

.. rubric:: AM335x-ICE-v2
   :name: am335x-ice-v2

This board has only 2 Ethernet ports that can be used either as CPSW
Ethernet or PRUSS Ethernet. For PRUSS Ethernet configration place
jumpers J18 and J19 at MII position before powering up the board.

.. rubric:: AM437x-IDK
   :name: am437x-idk

This board as one Gigabit (CPSW) Ethernert port and 2 PRUSS Ethernet
ports. No special board configuration is needed to use all ports.

.. rubric:: K2G-ICE EVM
   :name: k2g-ice-evm

This board has one Gigabit (netCP) Ethernet port and 4 PRUSS Ethernet
ports. No special board configuration is needed to use all ports.

.. rubric:: AM571x-IDK
   :name: am571x-idk

This board has 2 Gigabit (CPSW) Ethernet ports and 4 PRUSS Ethernet
ports. Due to pinmux limitations it can support either of the following
configurations

-  Jumper J51 placed. LCD + 2 Gigabit (CPSW) + 2 PRUSS Ethernet ports
   (PRU2\_ETH0 and PRU2\_ETH1)

**OR**

-  Jumper J51 removed. No LCD, 2 Gigabit (CPSW) + 4 PRUSS Ethernet
   ports.

NOTE: Jumper must be configured before powering up the board.

.. rubric:: AM572x-IDK
   :name: am572x-idk

This board has 2 Gigabit (CPSW) Ethernet ports and 4 PRUSS Ethernet
ports. However, only 2 Gigabit + 2 PRUSS Ethernet ports (PRU2\_ETH0 and
PRU2\_ETH1) are supported due to pinmux limitations.

NOTE: Only ES2.0 silicon (Board Rev1.3 or later) is supported as older
Silicon uses a older version of PRUSS core that is not compatible with
the supplied firmware.

.. rubric:: Kernel configuration
   :name: kernel-configuration

To enable/disable PRU Ethernet driver support, start the Linux Kernel Configuration tool:

::

    $ make menuconfig ARCH=arm

Make sure Remoteproc and PRUSS core driver is enabled.

Select Device drivers from the main menu.

::

        ...
        [*] Networking support --->
        Device Drivers -->
        File systems --->
        ...

Select Remoteproc drivers.

::

        ...
        [*] IOMMU Hardware Support  --->
        Remoteproc drivers  --->
        Rpmsg drivers  --->
        ...

Enable the below drivers.

.. rubric:: **Driver Usage & Testing**
   :name: driver-usage-testing

You can use standard Linux networking tools to test the networking
interface (e.g. ifconfig, ping, iperf, scp, ethtool, etc)
