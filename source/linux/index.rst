    .. note::
       | Processor SDK documentation is now created from reStructuredText sources using
         Sphinx, and hosted on ti.com instead of processors wiki - starting
         4.3 release.
       |
       | We intend to retain the look and feel of the content
         to make this transition seamless, and yet provide the users with the benefits of
         consuming the content generated with emergent documentation tools.
       |
       | Wiki content will be left for reference during this migration process to find any missing old content. Feel free to drop us a note using the
         forums listed at :ref:`Technical Support <overview-technical-support>`, and we would love to hear from you.
